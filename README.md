### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update

### Optimizations
This project was made using html, css and JS

### Lessons Learned
Math.random() method doesn't actually return a whole number. Instead, it returns a floating-point value between 0  and 1 .
