# Slot Machine

My practice project on how to make a slot machine.

**Link to project:** "###"

## How it's made

** Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I really had to think logically for this project. I had to create three different outcomes and also create a function where the game would do math with a press of a button. What is really cool and interesting is that there is more than one ways to tackle this code.
