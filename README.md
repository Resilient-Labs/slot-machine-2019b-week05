# Slot Machine Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

**Link to project:** https://duanesslotmachine.netlify.app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
I seperated the 3 reels into their own sections, and linked them to the same function. the function is a basic math.random function and returns 1 of 3 images. unless all images match the result is considered 'Loser' and returns such.

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)* -->

<!-- You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

The learning curve for me on this project was simplifying the reels. The only thing happening is the backgrounds for the sections are changing based upon the math.ranom outcome and returning an image.
