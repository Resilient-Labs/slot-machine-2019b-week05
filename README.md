## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I finished the html and css first. I had a lot of fun with the css for this project. I was able to use fonts from google fonts, applied text-shadow to the fonts to make it seem like a real casino and used images for the slots that a real slot-machine would have. 

## Lessons Learned:

A big part of the code for this project involved having multiple functions that preformed their own task. This project really showed me how to break up my code into different functions.
