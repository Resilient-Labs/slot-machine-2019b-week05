 This is a simple slot machine game. It is made of three individual viewing fields that display one at a time. There are 3 buttons to clikc, one will place a $5 bet, one will place a $50 bet and the third called "play now!' will start the game. Upon activating the 'Play now!' button will generate a random output of numbers. if the match then players balance will increase. if they do not match, players balance will decrease.

## Features

- This simple game features only areas to view results and players cash balance and buttons to play, making it very user friendly.
- there are buttons to switch between dollar bet value so the player has options.
- The balance that the player views is updated by the use of if/else if statements.
- I added a special bonus jackpot if statement that if the random numbers displayed ==== 333 the player gets an extra $2000 added to their balance.
- I added in failsafe that stops the game if the players balance falls below $5.. and a message is returned on the screen letting the player know they need to add more funds.
