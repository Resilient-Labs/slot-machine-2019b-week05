## How It's Made:
Slot Machine is built using the following technologies:
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Employed for client-side functionality.

Three random numbers between 1 and 5 are displayed. If none match the user loses their bet, if two match the user gains 2x their bet, if all three match the user wins 10 times their bet.

## What I Learned
- Using Math functions to get random integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive)
- Writing conditions to identify if there are matches and updating the total appropriately
